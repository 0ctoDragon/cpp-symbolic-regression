C++, Genetic Programming, Symbolic Regression

## Overview ##
This is a symbolic regression genetic programing system written in C++ using typed
genetic programming techniques. This software is a highly optimised GP system, which I developed to meet the specifications set out in the TinyGP competition of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) 2004.
